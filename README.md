## Hi 👋, I'm Muhammed Ali Geleş

I am a first-year student in the Computer Programming department at Istanbul Gelişim University. From the initial stage of my studies, I have focused on building a solid technical foundation through active practice in C and Java languages. My strongest assets include my problem-solving skills, analytical thinking ability, and high motivation to quickly adapt to new technologies.

I am a developer candidate with international experience and a strong aptitude for teamwork. Through the Erasmus+ project I participated in during high school (a partnership between Germany, Austria, and Turkey), I gained the opportunity to collaborate with different cultures and develop a global perspective. I support my technical development with my active efforts to improve my English language skills.

My goal is to specialize in the field of software development and become a software developer who creates value, both through individual contributions and as a strong team player.
