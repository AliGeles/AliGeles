I'm a first-year Computer Programming student at Istanbul Gelişim University. I'm constantly improving my skills in C and Java and aim to do so further. I'm particularly motivated in problem-solving, analytical thinking, and adapting to new technologies.
During high school, I participated in the Erasmus+ project, a joint effort between Germany, Austria, and Turkey, and gained a student experience. This experience gave me the opportunity to work with different cultures, integrate with teams, and gain an international perspective.
I'm also working to improve my English every day and continue to invest in myself academically and professionally.
My goal is to specialize in software development and become a software developer who creates value both individually and through teamwork.
