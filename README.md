I am a Computer Programming student who is passionate about improving myself in the world of software development.  
I actively work with C and Java, continuously expanding my knowledge and strengthening my analytical and problem-solving abilities.  

Through the Erasmus+ program, I had the opportunity to collaborate with students from different countries,  
which helped me gain an international perspective and develop teamwork and communication skills.  

I am currently focusing on improving my English and advancing both academically and professionally.  
My goal is to become a software developer who creates value through innovation, teamwork,  
and continuous learning.
